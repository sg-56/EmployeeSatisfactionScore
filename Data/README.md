## üì• Steps to Download the Dataset  

### Step 1: Install Kaggle CLI  
Make sure you have Python installed. Then install the Kaggle Python package:  

```bash
pip install kaggle
```  

### Step 2: Configure the Kaggle API Key  
Move the downloaded `kaggle.json` file to the appropriate location:  

```bash
# On Linux/MacOS:
mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
mv kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

# On Windows:
mkdir %USERPROFILE%\.kaggle
move kaggle.json %USERPROFILE%\.kaggle\
```  

### Step 3: Download the Dataset  
Use the Kaggle CLI to download the dataset:  

```bash
kaggle datasets download -d [dataset-identifier]
```  
- Replace `[dataset-identifier]` with the dataset's unique identifier found in the URL (e.g., `username/dataset-name`).  

### Step 4: Unzip the Dataset  
Once downloaded, unzip the file:  

```bash
unzip dataset-name.zip -d data/
```

## üõ† Verifying the Dataset  

Check if the dataset has been downloaded and extracted correctly:  

```bash
ls data/
```  

Ensure all expected files (e.g., CSV, images, etc.) are present in the `data/` folder.
